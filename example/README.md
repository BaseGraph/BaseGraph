## C++ CMake example

First step is to generate the CMake package file of the library. This done by executing
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
in the root directory `base_graph/` of this repository.

This example can then be compiled by running the following commands
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
in this `base_graph/example/` directory.

The executable of the examples will appear in the `build` directory.
