## C++ CMake example

The PGL static library must be compiled in `base_graph/build/src` order to compile this example. This is done by executing 
```sh
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ..
```
in the repository root directory.

This small example can then be compiled with the same command
```sh
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ..
```
in this directory.
