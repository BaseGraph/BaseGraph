Undirected graphs
=================

Undirected graphs contain edges that have no orientation (:math:`i\rightarrow
j` and :math:`j\rightarrow i` are equivalent). Vertices are
identified by an integer index, :ref:`VertexIndex <vertexindex>`, ranging from
:math:`0` to :math:`n-1`, where :math:`n` is the number of vertices.
