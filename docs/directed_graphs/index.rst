Directed graphs
===============

Directed graphs contain edges that possess an orientation (:math:`i\rightarrow
j` and :math:`j\rightarrow i` are different). Vertices are identified by an
integer index, :ref:`VertexIndex <vertexindex>`, ranging from :math:`0` to
:math:`n-1`, where :math:`n` is the number of vertices.
