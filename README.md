# PGL: A portable graph library

PGL provides a set of C++ objects and scripts to analyze, manipulate and simulate the structure of graphs (or [complex networks]).

Most of the core functionalities of the C++ library are available as a Python module. Objects in this module are wrappers around the C++ objects generated by [pybind11].

## Why another graph library?

The development of this library was motivated by the need of a __fast__, __lightweight__ and __customizable__ code, which was __easy to install__ and straightforward to deploy on __supercomputing facilities__ whose softwares are not always up-to-date.

At the beginning of this project, none of the existing high-quality libraries such as [graph-tool], [NetworkX] or [igraph] fulfilled the aforementionned requirements.

I therefore decided to start writing my own code, adding new features following the needs of my research. This is a work in progress; comments, suggestions, contributions and bug reports are welcomed.

## Requirements

  * A C++11 (or newer) compliant compiler
  * [CMake] 3.17+ for the C++ library
  * Python 3.X for the Python module
  * [pybind11] for the Python module


## Installation
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/antoineallard/base_graph.git
```

#### C++
To compile the static library, execute
```sh
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ..
```
The static library will appear as `build/src/libPGL.a` (the extension will vary depending on the operating system).

To link the library in another CMake project, use
```cmake
include_directories(/path/to/the/repository/include)
...
target_link_libraries(<TARGET> /path/to/the/repository/build/src/libBaseGraph.a)
```
A small example is provided in the ``example`` directory.

#### Python wrapper
After cloning the repository, execute
```sh
pip install .
```

## Testing
In order to build the unit tests, the option `BUILD_TESTS` must be toggled on
```
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=on ..
```
The option is saved in the CMake cache so it only needs to be set once.

The [GoogleTest] framework is used to manage the unit tests. GoogleTest does not need to be installed because it is automatically pulled from GitHub by the CMake build.
